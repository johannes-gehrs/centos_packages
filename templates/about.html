        <h2><a href="#about">About this project</a></h2>

        <p>This is a personal project by <a href="http://johannes.gehrs.me/">Johannes Gehrs</a>,
            not
            associated with CentOS. I was
            annoyed by the fact that I could not search for CentOS packages on the web and
            therefore wrote this webapp.</p>

        <p>This software is released under the MIT license and you can find the source code on
            <a href="#">Github</a>. The visual theme of this site is the Bootstrap-based <a
                        href="http://bootswatch.com/superhero/">Superhero</a>
            theme. Bootstrap includes <a href="http://glyphicons.com/">Glyphicons</a> which are
            used
            in this project. The search functionality is powered by <a
                    href="https://pythonhosted.org/Whoosh/">Whoosh</a>, and the pages are served
            by <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.</p>

        <p>The CentOS Plus repository is currently not searched because it's deactivated by
            default in CentOS and I wanted to keep things simple.</p>

                href="mailto:jgehrs@gmail.com">email</a>. If
            you have any specific
            improvement in mind you may rather want to create an issue or pull request at
